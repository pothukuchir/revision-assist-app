# Getting Started 

The idea of this app is to assist a user when a they read a book/article by helping them remember the key words. The app will take a snapshot everytime the user presses a shortcut (command + T), reads the image using Tesseract JS, filters the stop words and displays the keywords as a bubble map. Work in progress.
